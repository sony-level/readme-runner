and workflows in your README actually run as described.

Use this command to automatically run the documented steps from your README
so you can verify that the instructions remain up to date and working.`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// runCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// runCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
