// rootCmd represents the base command when called without any subcommands
var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "readme-runner",
	Short: "Run and verify code examples from README and documentation files",
	Long: `readme-runner executes code examples embedded in README and other
documentation files to ensure they stay correct and up to date.

By running your documented examples as part of CI or local checks,
readme-runner helps prevent code samples from drifting out of sync
with the actual behavior of your application.

Typical usage:
  readme-runner path/to/README.md
  readme-runner docs/ --recursive`,
	// Uncomment the following line if your bare application
	// has an action associated with it:
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
func Execute() {
	err := rootCmd.Execute()
	if err != nil {
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}

func init() {
	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.
	// Cobra supports persistent flags, which, if defined here,
	// will be global for your application.

	// rootCmd.PersistentFlags().StringVar(&cfgFile, "config", "", "config file (default is $HOME/.readme-runner.yaml)")

	// Cobra also supports local flags, which will only run
	// when this action is called directly.
	rootCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
